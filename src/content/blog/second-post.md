# Good bye 2017 :0:

Wow another amazing year has passed and I can not describe the feeling of this new adventure. I didn’t expect to travel to the other side of the world and live here in Europe for a year. 2016 left me with a lot of changes and scary moments in life that made me grow up more and more. Now 2017 even more changes, surprisingly raising the bar a lot more. I am very thankful though of having this opportunity to be in this unknown adventure. Leaving that to the side and talking more about tech this year I learn more stuff about react, redux, electron and many stuff about that ecosystem. Is amazing how react’s community is growing. Also this year left me with a different perspective on how to solve the problem of creating a new app/project. create-react-app was really inspiring to fix all my templates, a.k.a cloning a repo and deleting the stuff you won’t need. But it is essential to have these templates for basics apps and creating modules to increase productivity in this 2018. So here it comes the 2018 GOALS and the scary anual report.
