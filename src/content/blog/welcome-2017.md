Hi new year, I could not have imagine this year would end so great. Each year is so different and with so much opportunities that are changing my life, like the new job :D. My first task for this month is to end up with a boilerplate for a frontend and backend project with authentication.

I'm not sure yet but I'm thinking about using hapi or express... with react for sure.

```javascript
console.log("blog post in progress...")
```
